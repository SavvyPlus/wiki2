Admin Task :  Weekly Report
==================================

Created by Kate Daley on Feb 21, 2017

**Weekly Report location: S:\\MarketData\\Market Reports\\Weekly**

Every Monday, the following needs to be done to assist with the Weekly Report:

  

1.  Market News

After inserting the news of the day and the weekend, use the "Editor's Choice" filter in the Web Portal to show all of the articles that were a major feature. Compile 10-12 top articles into a Word document with the subject title and short description. Email to Carl.

  

2. Forward Prices

Open the Weekly Report PBI file found here:

S:\\IT\\Power BI\\Beta version\\Market Data\\Weekly Report.pbix

  

Open the spreadsheet:

S:\\Consulting\\AAA SavvyPlus Marketing\\Forward Prices\\PBI Forward Price Template

Update the areas in blue (ie. the date and all of the State's forward prices for Cal and Qtr)

  

Refresh the PowerBI report.

Change the dates on the two tables to filter on this week
